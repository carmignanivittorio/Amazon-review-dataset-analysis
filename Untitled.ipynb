       "[u'The best album ever!',\n",
       " u'im very disappointed in amazon, theyre startin 2 sell used albums in the new section, i ordered this new and it came with scratches and a crack, track 19 couldnt even play all the way, smh, amazon has got 2 do better',\n",
       " u'Euphoria is one of the reason why I bought this album, since the victory @ Eurovision Song Contest 2012. I\\'m Indonesian, but I watched the show, and love her performance.<br />My Fave Tracks :<br />- In My Head<br />- My Heart Is Refusing Me<br />- Euphoria<br />- Sober<br />- Crying Out Your Name<br />- Breaking The Robot<br />Loreen\\'s music is influenced by enigma, there are so many \\\\\\\\\"mysteries\\\\\\\\\" in every single track. Electro Pop, Euro,  Harmony Vocals, in \\\\\\\\\"Dark\\\\\\\\\" Nuance Reminds me the style of MDNA\\'s in Frozen.<br />Trust me, buy this album, and u\\'ll get the real european taste of her.',\n",
       " u\"I've been a fan since I was a kid. I haven't bought a new Billy Idol release since Charmed Life and to be honest I'd almost given up on him. I'm really pleased to say this is a great album. On first listen it's familiar but very fresh. Billy sounds as if he's really enjoying his work again. He's a great performer, he really delivers when he plays live and he clearly loves what he does.<br />If you are a long time fan or if you only know the hits then give this album a listen. Easily up there with his best work.\",\n",
       " u\"Bought this single as it was number 1 the day my daughter was born. Didn't like it at 1st but it's grown on me and now I love it. Great catchy tune.\",\n",

       " u'Brill',\n",
       " u'Mendelssohn 5 symphonies & 7 overtures.<br />This is a wonderful selection of the symphonic works of Mendelssohn. The second symphony is very impressive and full marks to the<br />choir and soloists. Claudio Abado and the orchestra cannot be faulted in the performances and for anyone wishing to be introduced<br />to the works of Mendelssohn I would unreservedly recommend this 4 CD set.',\n",
       " u'I can but go along with the other positive reviews of this wonderful collection. I am one of those unsophisticates who consider that Tchaikovsky was the greatest thing to hit classical music ever and the performances by this orchestra will surely take some beating.',\n",

The case was an absolute wreck and the CD holding mechanism was destroyed, plastic shards went all over the floor when I opened the case and the CD was scratched from the sharp bits inside the case. I am surprised the CD actually worked. I don't know if I'm just unlucky but don't buy a CD if you are not prepared to order a replacement if the first one is broken\",\n",

       " u'nice cd',\n",
       " u\"This is amazing stuff.  While initially it took a while to fully enjoy and appreciate this, we've had it in the car for the better part of a year, playing over and over, constantly, and my girls love it.  Thankfully we have had no reason to listen to the Frozen soundtrack for months! And with each listen different songs over the year have grown.  First standouts are Mary's Place and the title track, but the soulfulness of Nothing Man and You're Missing, with the uplifting gospel within City of Ruins, Into the Fire, and play-it-loud rock of Further on up the Road, and Countin on a Miracle, and pop of Lonesome Day make this album Classic Springsteen, and it will definitely remain in the car along with another Springsteen album 'Magic' for years to come. Clocking in at over 74 mins you get your money's worth, but the kids singing the la la la la chorus of The Rising at full voice from the back seat will be a priceless memory.  Much better than Let it Go.  This is a must have.\",\n",
       " u\"Ok, so the genius of Garth Brooks is not in question here.  I asked my wife to get me this (the \\xa319.99 version) as a birthday gift - two packed cd's plus a bonus DVD. There was another version available on Amazon for just over half the price but which clearly identified the disc as being Region 1, but nowhere in the product description did it list this as being Region 1 also - I mean, why would there be 2 versions of the same thing listed separately at different prices?  Had I known I would have asked for '...The Hits' for circa \\xa38 as I used to listen to it many years ago in tape and loved it then.<br />This double compilation is great however.  Many of the songs I already knew, but Good Ride Cowboy is a cracker and it's been a joy discovering new music from someone who hasn't been doing much recording these past few years.  Apart from the DVD being unplayable which was a disappointment I would have rated this the full 5 Stars.\",\n",

       " u'I love the songs and the way Charlotte\\xb4s and Jonathan\\xb4s voices express the tenderness of the music. I felt sad when I Heard In the arm of the angel because it reminds me of Princess Diana\\xb4s funeral although it is a wonderful song.',\n",

The T shirt is so small that it fits my son's action man but that is about all!<br /><br />Having contacted Amazon they advise that it is advertised as small and that is that. Be warned that when thy mean small it is small - a small child!!!\",\n",

       " u\"3 good CD's of a brilliant concert.  Some bests ever.  The sound is very good (but then so was the Charlie Miller remastered soundboard, if you knew how to get that), the best now available.<br /><br />The DVD is a must have too.  Film of the Aug 27 1972 concert is mixed with fascinating films of Neal Cassady, Ken and the Pranksters, and the Dead playing at Acid Test 6 at the Fillmore 8 Jan '66.  In retrospect Jan 66 and Aug 72 are only 6 1/2 years apart, but what a world-changing 6 years they were, and the Dead were at the very centre of that.\",\n",
       " u\"This cd is one of my new favourites, there isn't one song on there that I don't like. The only bad thing about it that I could find is that the last track is 2 songs in 1 when it would have been better if it was 2 seperate tracks.\",\n",
       " u'An awesome album!',\n",
       " u\"To be honest, every single Manics album since Everything Must Go has been a bit of a letdown for me.  There were always four or five songs which I would love but the rest would be at best average and at worst forgettable.  But thank God Futurology live up to expectations.  You have to give The Manics a lot of credit with trying new sounds and styles while still not selling out to their punk/heavy ideals.  With Futurology they have blended electronica with euro beats and made something which is uniquely them but as they have never sounded before.<br />I would say that the roots for this were lain down with the much misunderstood Lifeblood, but whereas there were weak moments on that album they have learned and improved on to great effect on Futurology.<br />I can't praise this album enough and it seems incredible that these songs were written alongside the meloncholoy/nostalgic songs that were on Rewind the Film.<br />I would also like to say that Nicky Wire seems to have found his bass playing niche as his work on this album is imo his most impressive.<br />If there is a good reason the UK should stay in the EU then this is it!\",\n",

Such a shame that it all ended in discord and disharmony but they left us this, possibly the apogee of their works.<br /><br />The final track is an uplifting experience, a chance to remind ourselves of the roots that were the Small Faces.

I must definitely have that one at a later time. Until then I will dream on to the sound of &#34;She Sells Sanctuary&#34;.\",\n",
       " u\"ZZ Top has a long and glorious track record of playing dirty, lowdown and swinging blues'n'boogie rock. For years they have toured the world with very little variation on a good old recipe, their oldest numbers always to the fore. This record will not change that! The audiences want the old stuff, and Billy Gibbons and co. is smart enough to apriciate that. But if you're the least bit curious, you pick this one up, it will convince you, that the ole geezers still can produce new material of the highest caliber, and if concert goers wasn't so damn consertive, then,....!\",\n",
       " u\"I find &#34;By A Thread&#34; to be the best studio album by Gov't Mule, a group with their forte clearly in the live arena. The writing is strong here, with fresh ideas and well executed. They are as always in fine form, playing with the strength, which comes with so many years spent on the road in one or another connection. As &#34;Allmann Brothers&#34; kin they simply carry on the torch layed down so many years ago!\",\n",

This album has a sentimental value to me, and I find the composition on some of the songs is fantastic, from a personal point of view. However, I will say that this album may not be for everyone. Most of my friends who have listened to this album haven't been keen on it. But, if you like Prog I think that there's a fighting chance that this album may appeal to you.\",\n",
       " u'I am a big fan of Taylor\\'s, and didnt hesitate to buy this album, and i dont regret it, every song is different and superb. It fits every mood, from \\\\\\\\\"begin again\\\\\\\\\" which is calming and soothing and goes back to her country roots, to \\\\\\\\\"22\\\\\\\\\" which just makes you want to dance. She tries a mixture of approaches to every song, such as dubstep \\\\\\\\\"I knew You Were trouble\\\\\\\\\" No song is the same,and each tells a differnet story.  Album also features Ed Sheeran, and Snow patrol singer Gary Lightbody. I would definatly reccomend this album to everyone!',\n",

       " u'Not my usual type of music but I loved the single from it. A lovely album  if you like folk music. Mikes a great singer/songwriter.',\n",
       " u\"I give this album 5 stars and here's why: every track on the album is GREAT, it really has work put into each of them and the production and Gaga's vocals are stunning! Just listening this in car with a stereo system amazed me, headphones and 5.1 sound system also gives that great vibe.<br /><br />Make sure you don't listen to it on crappy laptop speakers, though. Unless, you've got really good ones. The lame ones really don't serve anything.<br /><br />My favorite tracks would probably be Aura, G.U.Y, Sexxx Dreams, Venus, Gypsy, Do What U Want, Dope, MANiCURE, Applause. That's a lot and I'd name the whole album because it's just that good! There are no fillers, so the album never gets boring. ( my opinion )<br /><br />I've mentioned Gaga's beautiful vocals already but  I just love how she actually experiments with her voice, and not only voice, production, yes I mentioned that too in the beginning, but it's everything! Fresh. This album is like fresh air.<br /><br />When I got this album and held it in my hands I noticed the foil album cover. I was surprises, it's just really wonderful!<br /><br />I could talk and talk  about this but I just can't express how perfect this is for me.<br /><br />Thank you Lady Gaga for creating such a great album.\",\n",

Snowblind follows and has quickly become a favourite, for me third track and second single from Bloodsports It starts and ends with you is the key song on the album and is up there with Suede's best of the 90s.  This is an album which is deep, dark , thrilling and uplifting and should be on the shopping list of any 90s music fans.\",\n",

       " u\"I feel like only half the songs on the album are worth listening to. It's quite different from the full pop sound of Take That. This album is more raw. There is definitely a lot of meaning and heart in this album, but it only stands out on half the tracks. There are some gems on here: &#34;Face To Face (with Elton John)&#34; is a top quality pop song and is quite catchy. The lead single off the album, &#34;Let Me Go,&#34; took me a few listens to get into it, but now I really enjoy it. It's a great, up-tempo song with a different sound than we're used to hearing from Gary. &#34;Jump&#34; has got to be my favourite. Co-written with Tim Rice-Oxley of Keane, one of my dream songwriting collaborations produced a beautiful, deep piano song. Some of the other songs have deeper meanings and are more personal, but it doesn't translate into easily enjoyable music. I hate to say this, but &#34;Actress&#34; is absolute garbage. I was surprised, and not in a good way, when this song came on.<br /><br />The album is &#34;front-loaded.&#34; The best songs are in the beginning of the CD. It definitely takes a few listens to get into the songs individually, and the album as a whole. I don't think we've heard his best on here, which is what I thought we'd be getting.\",\n",

Highly recommended!\",\n",

No, it is not like his older stuff, but he's got to try something new as it will get boring for him and possibly boring for us. It has it all, upbeat songs (Queen of California, Something Like Olivia,) meaningful songs (Born and Raised, If I Ever Get Around to Living,) slow songs (Love is a Verb, A Face to Call Home,) and songs that tell a story (Walt Grace.) A must buy for any John Mayer fan.<br /><br />P.S Please don't compare to past albums, enjoy it for what it is.\",\n",

The &#34;Rarities&#34; could have included the live version of &#34;Ain't That Peculiar&#34;  the Mechanics played on a late night show and possibly some other acoustic or demo versions of some of the songs. I bet there are some versions of songs sung by Paul Carrack that are sung by Paul Young and vice versa when Mike tried to determine the best singer for a song. Overall both CD's are very good.\",\n",

       " u\"Needless to say that this is Kate's best album, and its groundbreaking nature is very well defined by both the experimental touch that Kate was able to manoeuvre so freely at will thanks to her exercise in the previous album The Dreaming, and its much more soothing melodies than in The Dreaming.<br /><br />I personally deem Hounds of Love as Kate's coming-of-age record because it evidences her matured singing technique that has grown so proficiently ever since her debut The Kick Inside. While abandoning her screechy high-pitched voice, she doesn't preclude herself from mastering an even wider vocal range and a sweeter, sexier vocal delivery.<br /><br />The first five tracks on this album can all serve alone as an instant hit. Popular-music oriented as they are, the complexity that carries all the beauty and idiosyncrasy imbues these songs with an unparalleled quality and uniqueness, which results in some of the greatest pop songs with a heavy touch of rock music, yet yielding progressiveness and an alternative vibe that distinguish themselves from the generic music on the market, and elevate themselves to the state of high art. From the very famous synth-pop-rock masterpiece Running up That Hill to another that's widely regarded as Kate's best, Cloudbusting, which delivers a very charming Anglo feel, the lilting and melodic songwriting is never downplayed. At the meantime these songs also employ the most groovy rhythms. So you'll find yourself prone to dance when hearing Hounds of Love and The Big Sky.<br /><br />On the other hand though, the second half the album is noticeably weaker than the first half. The idea behind these tracks on the second half is still very progressive, especially Waking the Witch, but they don't possess the enormous production that the first half features, and thus softer. But they are still much better in general than many of Kate's earlier works. Songs like Jig of Life and The Morning Fog feel like the northern breeze that blows the dewdrops on your face with you standing an Irish grassland in the sunrise.<br /><br />For those who haven't tried this album, it's obviously your best choice if you like other music from Kate, but if you've already listened to this album upon its initial release, beware that the third track The Big Sky is the Special Single Mix version released in 1986 as a 7&#34; single, rather than the album version in the original 1985 press of this album, because this item here is a reissue from Fish People recording company. The difference is that the Single Mix has a more delicate percussion replacing the original raw production in the standard album version. Some may be dissatisfied with this change but on the whole it's within an acceptable range because most features like voices and guitar work are untouched.<br /><br />By and large, Hounds of Love is Kate's best to date and is definitely one of the very memorable moments in British music history as well as in the alternative/art rock and pop-rock genre.\",\n",

The only regret for me was I only get hold of &#34;Everybody wants to rule the world&#34; in 12 inch single.  Now, with this edition... I had all of the singles released from the album.<br /><br />I had yet to play the 5.1 mix, but as a fan I also purchased the blu ray version on this title and Hurting.<br /><br />As for Amazon UK, I need to thank you for the nice packing, I received the titles in good shape.<br /><br />I can wait to play both the blu ray discs and treat myself to a music journey back in time on this coming weekend.<br /><br />Thanks again to Universal music to release this title.',\n",

       " u\"Firstly, I was very impressed with the delivery. It came before the expected date (which is always a plus) and wasn't broken or cracked. Secondly, I really enjoy this album. Not many people in the States are familiar with Nicole as a solo artist and I was happy to get both of her albums. I have listened to this and her other multiple times and I enjoy them both equally. Killer plover was more focused on dance and top 40 hits. This one I felt was slow to warm up to because it was so different. This is whybi enjoy it so much because it is so different from her previous work. I feel this one showcases more of her talent and she shines as a result. On big fat lie, my favorite songs would have to be: your love, on the rocks, God of war, girl with a diamond heart, bang and run. Honestly if your not a fan of pop, r and b or any of the current pop divas you will not enjoy this. For those of you who are its one to have for your collection. This is only reason I made an amazon account was to buy her new album, so I'm one satisfied customer.\",\n",

It may perhaps be my favorite album of his yet - especially as in this album, he breaks the 'audience-artist' barrier, getting into personal issues which have shaped him and more so some issues he has/ is still facing. This album has every emotion there is and will for whatever mood you are in. He has a range of songs (as versatile as he is ) from heavy drumbeat songs to slow chilled tunes, to falsetto strumming , and even heart breaking songs. He really shows us how incredible of  a singer he is with his amazing range. He truly is the world's greatest talent to have existed and I really want to experience him in live! His ability to tell a story in each song is beautiful andhe writes emotive lyrics ; telling a story which very few singers know how to do and in my opinion, mika does this best hands down . I could really go on forever about him and his voice and how great he is as a person. He IS one of the best songwriters alive (if not the best).<br />A must buy.\",\n",

One listen of Decode was enough to grab my attention back in the day and lead me to buy all their records and see them live a couple of times. It's no secret why they have a massive following because very few bands are far better live than they are on record and Paramore are one of those bands. If in doubt, check out Renegade on youtube, it's 4 minutes of pure brilliants. I guess you might either love or hate Hayley's voice but the way she sings around the melody's and bends her tone is simply amazing and unique. This latest album took a few listens to appreciate because tracks like &#34;Still into You&#34; seem too pop candy at first but the kick arse drumming and Hayley's edgy vocals keep it real. I play this record almost every day now, I love it!\",\n",

       " u\"Whatever Knopfler touches turns to gold, that's a fact. His previous albums were nothing short of masterpieces. However, it seems that he has chosen to forsake his old style as was recorded in &#34;Sailing to Philadelphia&#34;, &#34;Shangri-La&#34; and the rest. This album is very &#34;folky&#34; and soft and resembles his last albums, &#34;Privateering&#34; and &#34;Get Lucky&#34;, much more than any others. It's not necessarily a bad thing, for I will be grateful for whatever this legend will record. Dire Straits fans who never listened to one of his solo albums will be disappointed.<br />Maybe after listening to it a few more time (as often happens) I will upgrade the score to 5 stars. For now, it's good, but not perfect like many of his other creations.\",\n",

       " u\"Anything that could be said about this album has already been written, analysed and digested by any fans of Eric Clapton, Duane Allman, and the musicians who underpin it and bring it all together - Carl Radle, Bobby Whitlock and Jim Gordon, Ostensibly this is Clapton's album but I agree with everything that has been written prior, and that it that it is Duane Allman's beautiful lead, rhythm and in particular his slide guitar virtuoso playing that helps elevate this album to the heights to which it is broadly regarded. In my very humble view, a dissection of the tracks that feature on the album is pointless, as every song has its strengths and in that regard, every song on the album is worth tuning into to hear what it is that the band, as a cooperative, is trying to bring to the listener.A long time favorite album of mine and one that should have a place in the collection of any serious music enthusiast.\",\n",
       " u\"It would be easy for one to let emotions get the best of you when it comes to writing a review regarding this album, not least as it is the last album by The Allman Brothers to feature Duane Allman. The discerning listener is reqally spoilt for choice here, as you get to hear The Allman Brothers recorded both 'in the studio' and 'live;.The 'live' tracks on this album were some that didn't make it onto the live recording At Fillmore East album recorded in 1971. All in all, in my view, an important album for any fans of southern /blues rock, and that is coming from an Australian. If you are a fan of The Allman Brothers or a fan of exquisite slide and lead guitar provided by Duane Allman and Dicky Betts than this album should form part of your collection. Love from Australia.\",\n",

       " u'I assumed this album wouldn\\'t be as good as the greats, like seventh son of a seventh son, or number of the beast. But THIS is my favourite Maiden album now, it is simply outstanding.<br /><br />(I am only highlighting a few songs)<br /><br />\\\\\\\\\"Rainmaker\\\\\\\\\" is full of power, though it isn\\'t heavy, it is very nice to the ears.<br /><br />Another great goes by the name of \\\\\\\\\"Journeyman\\\\\\\\\" again, this isn\\'t in the traditional style Maiden are known to produce, however it is very energetic in it\\'s own way. and if you are ever in a depressed mood, this will certainly make you feel better.<br /><br />Passchendaele (Well, they call it \\\\\\\\\"Paschendale\\\\\\\\\") Is rather unique but still in the British metal style.<br /><br />\\\\\\\\\"No more lies\\\\\\\\\" has strong vocals and the chorus will get you singing along. I wouldn\\'t call it the best, but definitely a great.<br /><br />Dance of Death is the name of the album and I know why they chose that name, \\\\\\\\\"Dance of death\\\\\\\\\" is simply a must listen, Maiden sometimes make songs about adventures or rather mystical stories. A good example is \\\\\\\\\"Still life\\\\\\\\\" (In Piece of mind) But Dance of death really goes for the story telling and the general feel. I am very pleased with it.<br /><br />\\\\\\\\\"Montsegur\\\\\\\\\"? I think it is a bit over-rated although VERY CATCHY. I love it. :)<br /><br />All in all, Dance of Death is by far superior to other albums like Fear of the dark (And fear of the dark is a must get in my unpopular opinion) I cannot describe how amazed I was when I finished listening to it. I give this 5 stars. Effort= 10/10  Musical Talent= 9.4/10<br /><br />Maiden, you did NOT disappoint me. The Album in general deserves a solid 9.8/10  A few guitar solos were same-old same-old, but awesome nonetheless.',\n",

He has breathed new life into the solo artist, which is so refreshing. Love it.\",\n",
