    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com) provides throught its website a variety of information. We decided to focus our interest in the reviews the customers make for each product. Based on the knowledge we gained in the DTU course [02805 Social Graphs and Interactions](http://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02805), we wanted to gain more insights into\n",
    "the network of products and customers with the help of graph theory. Throught the process, we want to explore the data we have obtain and at the end, extract some meaningful conclusions related to our study. Most of the dataset is well constructed but not in the ideal format to be easily used. Thus, some cleaning and preprocessing tasks are required in order to make it accessible for the entire project, hence we will use some of the key techniques introduced in the course. Firstly, we will perform network analysis in order to to explore connections between products and customers, find properties like communities among the customers and the products or find the best product based on the category. Though graphs we will make clear which category is more reviewed or the scale of the star-rating on the reviews. And finally, we will perfomce text analysis in order to retrieve patterns between categories and star-ratings.\n"

    ">**What went well?**\n",
    "1. ***Data Processing***: The dataset we selected for our project was clean in general and not many processes were needed to clean it. The dataset was well documented and organized and that made the process of transforming the data to an easier format for us. As there were a lot of topics within this assignment, it was easy to distribute work tasks within the group.\n",
    "2. ***Network analysis***: \n",
    "3. ***Text Analysis***: Given the amount of data, we had to make functions as efficiently as possible. In fact, the same functions used in the previous assignments did not work. Apart from these inconveniences (which took us a lot of times), we were able to perform and explore different measurements and analysis different from the ones we have done in the previous assignments. As could be imagined, we really liked working with TF-IDF and create different interesting graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**What is still missing? What could be improved?, Why?**\n",
    "1. ***Data Processing***: The only thing it can be done to improve the dataset could be download a bigger one. Maybe, wuold it better to have a more uniform one. In this way, probably, the measurments would be less biased.\n",
    "2. ***Network analysis***:\n",
    "3. ***Text Analysis***: We tried to do as much as possible things as we could. Would be intersting to find people which have the same style in writing, creating a tf-idf vector for each person and then study the similarity. A more advanced analysis could be performed in terms of sentimental analysis of the worst/best product. Moreover, we could find which are the happiest/saddest words within a category (we did not focus on this task because we already did in the assignment)."
