### **Motivation behind this Project**

[Amazon](www.amazon.com) provides throught its website a variety of information. We decided to focus our interest in the reviews the customers make for each product. Based on the knowledge we gained in the DTU course [02805 Social Graphs and Interactions](http://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02805), we wanted to gain more insights into
the network of products and customers with the help of graph theory.

Throught the process, we want to explore the data we have obtain and at the end, extract some meaningful conclusions related to our study.
